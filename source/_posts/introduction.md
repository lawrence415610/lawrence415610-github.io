This is a blog recording software engineering learning. It is good for a life-long learner to keep a blog to record and track his learning process. Study can be fun and lonely. It takes endless time and patience to keep going forward. I have been wanting to keep a blog for long, however, writing blogs can be time-consuming. So instead of writing a blog with full explaination, this blog only records the knowledge points that I encountered in study, so that I can always go back and see this journey of learning.
